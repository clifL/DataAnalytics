Qns1) Tutorial 3 & 4
Step 1: Arrange the data into 2D
Step 2: Determine which features are meaningful for data mining (Should i use all feature or some features?)
Step 3: Eigendecomposition
PCA is to capture changes, since 2 is a constant in feature 3, thus the result gotten will be 0, it means there is no variant occupy by the 3rd feature
Step 4: Get the features that adds up to (>=65%) then rest of the features throw away
(Note in lab 2, prof will only want us to capture 2 ~ 3 features only)
Step 4.5: We need to drop the non-constant features in lab test


Step 5: Do plotting - Need to know how to plot in terms of 3D or else PC1 to PC2, PC2 to PC3
